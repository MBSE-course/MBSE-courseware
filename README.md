**Curriculum Module**  
_Created with R2024b. Compatible with R2024b and later releases._  

## Description

This courseware on Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) addresses the various phases of moodel-based R&D projects and the specific tasks involved in each phase. During the course, we provide examples of how Mathworks' tools such as System Composer, Simulink Test, and State Flow support the MBSE process.\
\
Moreover, the interactive courseware uses extensively the [MATLAB&reg;](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) Live Editor for the development and the presentation.\
\
Each chapter ends with a quiz to test your knowledge and understanding, many chapters provide exercises with the tools to improve your practical MBSE skills.

## Contents
The repository contains the following Live Scripts and folders:

- **``CoursewareonModelBasedSystemsEngineering.prj``**\
This is the MATLAB project file which sets up all necessary dependencies

- **``MBSE(1).mlx``**\
This is the main document that can be used to navigate to the rest of the Live Scripts in the repository

- **``Chapters/``**\
This folder contains the Live Scripts of the course chapters
  - **``Introduction(2).mlx``**\
  A real-world example is NASA's use of MBSE in developing spacecraft:\

## Concepts
Model Based Systems Engineering, requirements gathering, requirements analyzing, stereotypes, architecting, high-level design, low-level design, behavioral modelling, testing, implementation.

## Suggested Audience
All engineering disciplines, such as, electrical engineers, mechatronics engineers, mechanical engineers, etc.

## Workflow
Firstly, open the project file CoursewareonFiniteElementMethods.prj to have all the folder dependencies resolved. Then, open Live Script **MBSE(1).mlx** to start the course. Stay in the MBSE folder (so not in the chapters folder) for navigating through the course chapters.

## Release last tested
